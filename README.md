README file for Jupiter Age Calculator

This simple Jupiter Age Calculator project was developed in C# to provide an easy way to calculate a person's age on Jupiter before and after a journey to the gas giant.

To use the calculator, simply enter your birth date, and the tool will provide you with your age in Earth years, Jupiter years, and your age on Jupiter both before and after the trip.

Installation and Usage

To use this project, you will need to have a development environment for C# installed on your computer. The recommended development environment is Visual Studio, which can be downloaded from the Microsoft website, but I use Rider which can be gotten from the jetbrains.com.

Once you have installed a development environment for C#, you can download or clone this project from the GitHub repository.

To run the project, open the project solution file in your development environment and build the solution. After building the solution, you can run the Jupiter Age Calculator application and start calculating your age on Jupiter!
